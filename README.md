# Smart-fault-monitoring-of-Transformers

A smart IoT based fault detection and location system was used to 
indicate and locate the exact spot where fault had occurred. It will provide a 
shorter response time for technical crew to rectify these faults and thus help to 
save transformers from damage and crash. These systems use a current 
transformer, a voltage transformer, ARDUINO Microcontroller. 

Simulation of the project done in the proteus.I have dumped the hex code in the audrino after connecting all the components in the Proteus.
